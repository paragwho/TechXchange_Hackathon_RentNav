## ❓ What is Rentnav?

Welcome to **Rentnav**, a web platform built on **WatsonX Granite model**, designed to simplify the rental experience by providing **transparent rental price insights** and **clear landlord–tenant rights guidance**.

Rentnav tackles one of the biggest pain points in housing: the lack of transparency around **fair rent values** and confusion about **legal rights**. By combining data-driven rental intelligence with explainable legal information, Rentnav empowers both tenants and landlords to make informed, confident, and fair decisions.

This project was developed as part of the **WatsonX Hackathon**, and we believe Rentnav has the potential to transform how people navigate the housing rental ecosystem.

## 🎯 Why Rentnav?

We built Rentnav with one clear goal: **to bring fairness, clarity, and trust to renting.**

Whether it’s finding out the fair market value of a house, understanding lease laws in your jurisdiction, or resolving disputes like deposit returns, Rentnav uses AI to deliver actionable insights instantly.

> 🏠 **Knowledge is protection**: by combining rent analytics with legal literacy, Rentnav prevents disputes before they start.

## 🚀 Features

Rentnav connects to multiple datasets—rental listings, government registries, legal documents—and enables users to interact with them in powerful ways. For this hackathon, we’ve built **four key modules** to demonstrate the platform’s potential.

### 1. **Smart Rent Benchmarks**

* **Granite-powered analysis**: Outlier detection and dynamic trends ensure accuracy.
* **Future Potential**: Personalized affordability suggestions based on commute and lifestyle.

> 💰 **Never overpay** by knowing the real market price.

### 2. **Rights Advisor**

* **Plain-language legal summaries**: Understand local landlord–tenant laws instantly.
* **Granite-powered RAG**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation from rent acts, statutes, and FAQs.
* **Cited outputs**: All rights explanations are backed with official sources and last-updated dates.

> ⚖️ **Prevent disputes** with clear knowledge of your rights.

* **Future Potential**: Integration with mediation/legal aid services.

> ✉️ **Save time & stress** by automating dispute resolution.

---

### 4. **Affordability & Alternatives**

* **Budget-aware suggestions**: If an area is too costly, get nearby affordable options with rent data and commute times.

## 🙌 Conclusion

Rentnav is just the beginning. We envision this platform scaling globally, empowering **tenants and landlords** to make smarter, fairer, and more transparent rental decisions.

While this is just a proof-of-concept, we are excited about the possibilities of **WatsonX Granite** and agentic AI to transform real estate—and we look forward to building Rentnav further.

**Thank you for checking out Rentnav!** We hope to see you at the WatsonX Hackathon finals in Orlando!
