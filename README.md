## ❓ What is RentNav?

Welcome to **RentNav**, a web platform built on **WatsonX Granite model**, designed to simplify the rental experience by providing **transparent rental price insights** and **clear landlord–tenant rights guidance**.

RentNav tackles one of the biggest pain points in housing: the lack of transparency around **fair rent values** and confusion about **legal rights**. By combining data-driven rental intelligence with explainable legal information, RentNav empowers both tenants and landlords to make informed, confident, and fair decisions.

This project was developed as part of the **WatsonX Hackathon**, and we believe RentNav has the potential to transform how people navigate the housing rental ecosystem.

> 🏠 **Knowledge is protection**: by combining rent analytics with legal literacy, RentNav prevents disputes before they start.

## 🚀 Features

RentNav connects to multiple datasets—rental listings, government registries, legal documents—and enables users to interact with them in powerful ways. For this hackathon, we’ve built **four key modules** to demonstrate the platform’s potential.

### 1. **Smart Rent Benchmarks**

* **Transparent rent values**: Know the fair p25, p50, p75 benchmarks for your city/locality and property type.
* **Granite-powered analysis**: Outlier detection and dynamic trends ensure accuracy.
* **Future Potential**: Personalized affordability suggestions based on commute and lifestyle.

> 💰 **Never overpay** by knowing the real market price.

### 2. **Rights Advisor**

* **Plain-language legal summaries**: Understand local landlord–tenant laws instantly.
* **Granite-powered RAG**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation from rent acts, statutes, and FAQs.
* **Cited outputs**: All rights explanations are backed with official sources and last-updated dates.

> ⚖️ **Prevent disputes** with clear knowledge of your rights.

---

### 3. **Dispute Helper**

* **AI-guided remedies**: Step-by-step resolution flows for common disputes (e.g., deposit not returned, illegal rent hike).
* **Future Potential**: Integration with mediation/legal aid services.

> ✉️ **Save time & stress** by automating dispute resolution.

---

### 4. **Affordability & Alternatives**

* **Budget-aware suggestions**: If an area is too costly, get nearby affordable options with rent data and commute times.

## 🙌 Conclusion

RentNav is just the beginning. We envision this platform scaling globally, empowering **tenants and landlords** to make smarter, fairer, and more transparent rental decisions.

While this is just a proof-of-concept, we are excited about the possibilities of **WatsonX Granite** and agentic AI to transform real estate—and we look forward to building RentNav further.
